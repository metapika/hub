      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio. I am a Solo Game Developer working on my life-long passion project <span class="purple">NEONRAIL</span>. A primarily-video-game media franchise where all the stories take place in the same one Universe. 
        <br>
          Currently there two mainline releases in this project - <b>RoboSamurai</b> and the recently finished <b>HyperDissonance</b>! 
          Both playable on Steam. 
          Below you can find out more about my projects and what I can do along with links to all my related accounts on different platforms.

            <h4>Programming</h4>
            <div class="project_desc">
              I've been coding in Python since I was a little kid. For the past 5 years I've worked on multiple Unity projects where I perfected my knowledge of both the engine and the C# Programming Language. For the past year I've been learning Godot and GDScript, which posed no challenge to me.

            <h4>Game Design & Cooperation</h4>
            <div class="project_desc">
              With 2 major commercial projects released and countless mini, learning-focused ones I've mastered the art of Game Design. I am able to efficiently create intuitive and fun game mechanics for my games alongside good game-feel and feedback to the player. In my newest project <b>HyperDissonance</b> I teamed up with another developer by the name of autoselff in order to create the game as good and as fast as it was possible. This project taught me everything I need to know to manage a duo team and lead the project to it's completion.

            <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
            <div class="project_desc">
              When I first tried Inkscape in 2017 I immediately fell in love with it. Ever since then I've been using the program basically daily in order to make everything related to 2D and Vector Graphic Design for all my projects. Logos, UI Elements, banners, plans, I can create everything I need very efficiently.

            <h4>3D Modelling</h4>
            <div class="project_desc">
              During the solo development of <b>RoboSamurai</b> I had to learn the entirety of <b>Blender</b> in order to create fully rigged and textured characters, robots, deadly weapons and beautifully stylized environments. In order to finish the project I had to master everything related to 3D Graphics which included things like: modelling, concept-arting, UV unwrapping, texturing, animation and much more. This allowed me to create most of the models that can be seen in <b>HyperDissonance</b>.            </div>
